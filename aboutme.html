<section id="bodytext">
    I am a BIS student at Mississippi State University, and I thoroughly love anything IT related. I have been programming a little over a 2 years now and am experienced with back-end dev using PHP, Python, and SQL. I also have some front end skills, just enough to design this website. I am presently exploring more database management and data analytics pairing SQL and Tableaux.
